# libtouptek

Not entirely sure where I'm going with this at the moment, but it
could turn into a single open source implementation of (some of) the
Touptek SDKs for cameras sold under their own brand and others, for
example Altair, Mallincam, Meade (some), Risingcam, Levenhuk(?),
Omegon, Orion (some), Opticstar (some) and I'm sure, others.
